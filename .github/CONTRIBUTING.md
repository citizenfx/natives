Contributing
============

Contributions are greatly appreciated! Some topics to contribute on:

- Documenting functionality of natives
- Documenting parameter and return types
- Naming unnamed natives appropriately
- Adding example code to natives
- Reviewing existing pull requests

Guidelines
----------

Before you create a pull request, please adhere to these guidelines.

### Naming convention

Natives go by a simple naming convention which should be adhered to.

- Filenames are in PascalCase, e.g. `GetEntityCoords.md`
- Native names are in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, e.g. `GET_ENTITY_COORDS`
- Community-named natives must be prefixed by an underscore, e.g. `_EXAMPLE_NATIVE`

> Community-named natives have names that do not match the hash of the native.

When renaming a native, remember to:
- Keep an alias of the old name. This is necessary for backwards compatibility.
- Rename the file to match the new name.

### Descriptions
The description of a native should be clear. Avoid descriptions such as "unsure what this does" or "needs research". Minimize incomplete information. Shortly describe what the native does, or what it's used for.

> Descriptions should not be code fenced. They are only used for NativeDB imports.

### Parameter and return types
Parameter and return type annotations are in C syntax. Each parameter and return type can be individually documented. See below for an [example](#example-documentation).

### Renaming parameters
When renaming a parameter, remember to also update the `## Parameters` section to match the parameter you just changed.

### Changing parameter or return types
Changes must be backwards compatible, if you are changing a parameter type or return type it's imperative to prepend `cs_type` to the type you changed, for example, if the old type were `Any` and it's changed to `float`, the current declaration should be `cs_type(Any) float x`.

You don't have to use `cs_type` for any native that is treated like an `int`, you can find such types [in the codegen_types.lua](https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem/blob/master/ext/natives/codegen_types.lua). Although `uint` and `Hash`  are listed in the `codegen_types.lua` as `int` they are handled internally in the C# code gen as `uint`, so you **must** cast these types via `cs_type`.

You can check out these documented natives, [SET_RANDOM_BOATS](../VEHICLE/SetRandomBoats.md) and [SET_TRAIN_SPEED](../VEHICLE/SetTrainSpeed.md) to see exactly how `cs_type` declarations should be used.

### Adding examples
When adding example code, start out with Lua. It's possible to add extra examples for JavaScript and C# as well. See below for an [example](#example-documentation) on how to do so. Examples in different languages must be functionally identical.

### External links
Avoid external links such as Pastebin or personal blogs when possible, as these may be removed over time. If you do need to link externally, make sure its as permanent as possible, such as by adding it do the [FiveM documentation][fivem-docs].

### Natives from the CFX namespace
This repository only contains original GTA V natives.
Natives from the CFX namespace can be found in the [FiveM source][cfx-natives].

### Things to keep in mind
- Descriptions should not be code fenced.
- Mind your grammar. Everyone benefits from correct English.
- Don't add any markdown files that aren't natives.
- Don't use double hashes to declare new markdown headers in description blocks (it's not supported), use triple hashes instead. 
- Try to avoid entering values that other readers won't be able to understand. Research the value on a site such as [Wolfram Alpha](https://wolframalpha.com) to see if there's an underlying reason for it, for example a value of `0.017453292`, would be `π/180` or simply `3.14159265359/180`.

Submitting a pull request
-------------------------

With over 5000 natives, it's hard for us to manually review and test all contributions. We love to see a well tested example to validate your change in the pull request description. Doing so will allow us to review your change much faster, and avoids untested or wrong information. This includes:

- Code to test and validate your change with
- Screenshots showcasing what the change is about
- Source material of used information

Example documentation
---------------------
Below an example of how natives are documented. Other good examples are [GET_ENTITY_COORDS](../ENTITY/GetEntityCoords.md) and [GET_PLAYER_PED](../PLAYER/GetPlayerPed.md).
