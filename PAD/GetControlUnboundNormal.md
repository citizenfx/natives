## GET_CONTROL_UNBOUND_NORMAL

```c
// 0x5B84D09CEC5209C5 0xC49343BB
float GET_CONTROL_UNBOUND_NORMAL(int inputGroup, int control);
```

```
Seems to return values between -1 and 1 for controls like gas and steering.  
0, 1 and 2 used in the scripts. 0 is by far the most common of them.  
```

## Parameters
* **inputGroup**: 
* **control**: 

## Return value
