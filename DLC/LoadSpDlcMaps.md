## _LOAD_SP_DLC_MAPS

```c
// 0xD7C10C4A637992C9 0x8BF60FC3
void _LOAD_SP_DLC_MAPS();
```

```
Unloads GROUP_MAP (GTAO/MP) DLC data and loads GROUP_MAP_SP DLC. Neither are loaded by default, 0888C3502DBBEEF5 is a cognate to this function and loads MP DLC (and unloads SP DLC by extension).  
The original (and wrong) definition is below:  
This unload the GTA:O DLC map parts (like high end garages/apartments).  
Works in singleplayer.
