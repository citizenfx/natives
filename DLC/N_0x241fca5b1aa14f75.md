## _0x241FCA5B1AA14F75

```c
// 0x241FCA5B1AA14F75 0x0AF83036
BOOL _0x241FCA5B1AA14F75();
```

```
Only used once in scripts, in maintransition.
maintransition.c4, line ~82432:
if (PED::_7350823473013C02(PLAYER::PLAYER_PED_ID()) && (DECORATOR::_241FCA5B1AA14F75() == 0)) {
    g_2542A5 = a_1; // 'g_2542A5' used in 'building_controller.ysc' for IPL stuff?
    return 1;
}
Likely used solely for the players ped. The function it's in seems to only be used for initialization/quitting. Called among natives to discard scaleforms, disable frontend, fading in/out, etc. Neighboring strings to some calls include "HUD_JOINING", "HUD_QUITTING".
Most likely ARE_*
```

## Return value
