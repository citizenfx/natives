## _0x2C173AE2BDB9385E

```c
// 0x2C173AE2BDB9385E
int _0x2C173AE2BDB9385E(Blip blip);
```

Seems to always return 0 from what I can tell. I've tried a lot of different blip related natives and it always seems to return 0.
Decompiled scripts always pass a blip handle as p0.


```
// freemode.c
if (HUD::DOES_BLIP_EXIST(Global_2415594[iParam0]))
{
    if (HUD::_0x2C173AE2BDB9385E(Global_2415594[iParam0]) != 0)
    {
        return 1;
    }
}
```

## Parameters
* **blip**: The blip to check.

## Return value
Seems to always return 0 from what I can tell. I've tried a lot of different blip related natives and it always seems to return 0.
