## _0x2C173AE2BDB9385E

```c
// 0x2C173AE2BDB9385E
int _0x2C173AE2BDB9385E(Blip blip);
```

GET_BLIP_*
Seems to always return 0 from what I can tell. I've tried a lot of different blip related natives and it always seems to return 0. Decompiled scripts always pass a blip handle as p0.

## Parameters
* **blip**: The blip to check.

## Return value
Seems to always return 0 from what I can tell. I've tried a lot of different blip related natives and it always seems to return 0.
