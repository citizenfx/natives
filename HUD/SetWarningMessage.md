## Examples
```lua
-- Make the first line using custom text.
AddTextEntry("warning_message_first_line", "This is the first line.")

-- Make the second line using custom text.
AddTextEntry("warning_message_second_line", "This is the second line!")

-- Add an event handler for when the screen is dismissed.
AddEventHandler("optionSelected", function(selected)
    print(selected) -- do whatever you want with the selected choice.
    -- players can either press the physicial buttons, or they can click
    -- the instructional buttons with their mouse and it will trigger
    -- the event as well.
end)


-- Create a thread to loop this warning message.
CreateThread(function()
    while true do
        Wait(0)
        -- Display the warning message every tick.
        SetWarningMessage("warning_message_first_line", 82, "warning_message_second_line", 0, -1, true, 0, 0, 0)
        
        -- Check for key presses or instructional button clicks.
        -- Input group of 2 is required for this to work while the warning is being displayed.
        
        if (IsControlJustReleased(2, 201) or IsControlJustReleased(2, 217)) then -- any select/confirm key was pressed.
            TriggerEvent("optionSelected", "select")
            break
        elseif (IsControlJustReleased(2, 203)) then -- spacebar/x on controller (alt option) was pressed.
            TriggerEvent("optionSelected", "alt")
            break
        elseif (IsControlJustReleased(2, 202)) then -- any of the cancel/back buttons was pressed
            TriggerEvent("optionSelected", "cancel")
            break
        end
    end
