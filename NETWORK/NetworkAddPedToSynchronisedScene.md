## NETWORK_ADD_PED_TO_SYNCHRONISED_SCENE

```c
// 0x742A637471BCECD9 0xB386713E
void NETWORK_ADD_PED_TO_SYNCHRONISED_SCENE(Ped ped, int netScene, char* animDict, char* animClip, float blendInSpeed, float blendOutSpeed, int syncedSceneFlags, int ragdollFlags, float moverBlendInDelta, int ikFlags);
```

Adds a ped to a networked synchronised scene.

Synchronized scene playback flags (Also works in other `NETWORK_ADD_*_TO_SYNCHRONISED_SCENE` natives):
|Value| Name | Notes |
|:----:|:------:| :--------: |
|`0`| None | No flag set. |
|`1`| USE_PHYSICS | Allows the ped to have physics during the scene. |
|`2`| TAG_SYNC_OUT | The task will do a tag synchronized blend out with the movement behaviour of the ped. |
|`4`| DONT_INTERRUPT | The scene will not be interrupted by external events. |
|`8`| ON_ABORT_STOP_SCENE | The scene will be stopped if the scripted task is aborted. |
|`16`| ABORT_ON_WEAPON_DAMAGE | The scene will be stopped if the ped is damaged by a weapon. |
|`32`| BLOCK_MOVER_UPDATE | The task will not update the mover. |
|`64`| LOOP_WITHIN_SCENE | Animations within this scene will be looped until the scene is finished. |
|`128`| PRESERVE_VELOCITY | The task will keep it's velocity when the scene is cleaned up/stopped. Do note that the `USE_PHYSICS` flag must also be present. |
|`256`| EXPAND_PED_CAPSULE_FROM_SKELETON | The task will apply the `ExpandPedCapsuleFromSkeleton` reset flag to the ped (See [`SET_PED_RESET_FLAG`](#_0xC1E8A365BF3B29F2)). |
|`512`| ACTIVATE_RAGDOLL_ON_COLLISION | The ped will be ragdoll if it comes in contact with an object. |
|`1024`| HIDE_WEAPON | The ped's current weapon will be hidden during the scene. |
|`2048`| ABORT_ON_DEATH | The synchronised scene will be aborted if the ped dies. |
|`4096`| VEHICLE_ABORT_ON_LARGE_IMPACT | If the scene is running on a vehicle, then it will be aborted if the vehicle takes a heavy collision with another vehicle. |
|`16384`| PROCESS_ATTACHMENTS_ON_START | Attachments will be processed at the start of the scene. |
|`32768`| NET_ON_EARLY_NON_PED_STOP_RETURN_TO_START |  A non-ped entity will be returned to their starting position if the scene finishes early. |
|`65536`| SET_PED_OUT_OF_VEHICLE_AT_START | If the ped is in a vehicle when the scene starts, it will be set out of the vehicle. |
|`131072`| NET_DISREGARD_ATTACHMENT_CHECKS | Attachment checks will be disregarded when the scene is running. |

These flags can be combined with the `|` operator.

## Parameters
* **ped**: Ped handle to add.
* **netScene**: Network scene handle (Returned by [`NETWORK_CREATE_SYNCHRONISED_SCENE`](#_0x7CD6BC4C2BBDD526))
* **animDict**: Dictionary of the animation that the ped will play. Network synchronised scenes don't require the animation dictionary to be loaded, unlike [`TASK_SYNCHRONIZED_SCENE`](#_0xEEA929141F699854).
* **animClip**: Clip name from the anim dictionary that the ped will play.
* **blendInSpeed**: Blend in speed. The lower the value, the slower the blend in speed is. Default is `8.0`.
* **blendOutSpeed**: Blend out speed. This should be the negative value of `blendInSpeed`. Default is `-8.0`.
* **syncedSceneFlags**: Synchronized scene flags bit field from the above table.
* **ragdollFlags**: Ragdoll blocking flags. Default is `0`.
* **moverBlendInDelta**: Determines the rate at which the mover blends in to the scene. Useful for ensuring a seamless entry onto a synchronized scene. Default is `1000.0`.
* **ikFlags**: Inverse kinematics flags. Default is `0`.
