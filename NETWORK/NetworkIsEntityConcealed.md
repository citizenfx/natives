## _NETWORK_IS_ENTITY_CONCEALED

```c
// 0x71302EC70689052A
BOOL _NETWORK_IS_ENTITY_CONCEALED(Entity entity);
```

Note: This only works for vehicles, which appears to be a bug (since the setter _does_ work for every entity type and the name is 99% correct).

## Parameters
* **entity**: 

## Return value
