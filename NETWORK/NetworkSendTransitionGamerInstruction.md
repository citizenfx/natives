## NETWORK_SEND_TRANSITION_GAMER_INSTRUCTION

```c
// 0x31D1D2B858D25E6B 0x468B0884
BOOL NETWORK_SEND_TRANSITION_GAMER_INSTRUCTION(int* networkHandle, char* p1, int p2, int p3, BOOL p4);
```

```
the first arg seems to be the network player handle (&handle) and the second var is pretty much always "" and the third seems to be a number between 0 and ~10 and the 4th is is something like 0 to 5 and I guess the 5th is a bool cuz it is always 0 or 1  
does this send an invite to a player?  
```

* **networkHandle**: 
* **p1**:
