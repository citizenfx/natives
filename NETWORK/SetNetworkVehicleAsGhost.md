## SET_NETWORK_VEHICLE_AS_GHOST

```c
// 0x6274C4712850841E 0xEA235081
void SET_NETWORK_VEHICLE_AS_GHOST(Vehicle vehicle, BOOL toggle);
```

```
Original put name,  
_SET_NETWORK_VEHICLE_NON_CONTACT  
However changed to 'object' as the instances where this is called in scripts both freemode and golf it's only used on objects after the objects are called OBJ_TO_NET p_parachute_s (freemode) prop_golf_ball (golf). Tho the script search was done via TU27 Xbox360 ones.  
Got my hopes up whoever put this as vehicle. I was hoping it was what R* used in non-contact races.  
```

## Parameters
* **vehicle**: 
* **toggle**:
