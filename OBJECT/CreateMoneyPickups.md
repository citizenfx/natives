Spawns 3 spray cans that'll collectively give $1000 when picked up. (Three spray cans, each giving $334, $334, $332 = $1000).  
==============================================  
Max is 2000 in MP. So if you put the amount to 20, but the value to $400,000 eg. They will only be able to pickup 20 - $2,000 bags. So, $40,000
