## STOP_RENDERING_SCRIPT_CAMS_USING_CATCH_UP

```c
// 0xC819F3CBB62BF692 0xD3C08183
void STOP_RENDERING_SCRIPT_CAMS_USING_CATCH_UP(BOOL bShouldApplyAcrossAllThreads, float distanceToBlend, int blendType);
```

Instructs the game engine to stop rendering scripted cameras and transition back to the gameplay camera, optionally applying custom blending and rendering options.

```c
enum eRenderingOptionFlags {
    RO_NO_OPTIONS = 0,
    RO_STOP_RENDERING_OPTION_WHEN_PLAYER_EXITS_INTO_COVER = 1
};
```

```c
enum eCamSplineSmoothingFlags {
    CAM_SPLINE_NO_SMOOTH                = 0,    // No smoothing just moves at a constant rate
    CAM_SPLINE_SLOW_IN_SMOOTH           = 1,    // Decelerates when approaching a node
    CAM_SPLINE_SLOW_OUT_SMOOTH          = 2,    // Accelerates slowly when leaving a node
    CAM_SPLINE_SLOW_IN_OUT_SMOOTH       = 3,    // Decelerates when approaching a node and accelerates slowly when leaving a node
    CAM_SPLINE_VERY_SLOW_IN             = 4, 
    CAM_SPLINE_VERY_SLOW_OUT            = 5,

    CAM_SPLINE_CUBIC_EASE_OUT           = 15, 
    CAM_SPLINE_CUBIC_EASE_IN_OUT        = 16, 
    CAM_SPLINE_QUARTIC_EASE_IN          = 17, 
    CAM_SPLINE_QUARTIC_EASE_OUT         = 18, 
    CAM_SPLINE_QUARTIC_EASE_IN_OUT      = 19, 
    CAM_SPLINE_QUINTIC_EASE_IN          = 20, 
    CAM_SPLINE_QUINTIC_EASE_OUT         = 21, 
    CAM_SPLINE_QUINTIC_EASE_IN_OUT      = 22, 
    CAM_SPLINE_CIRCULAR_EASE_IN         = 23, 
    CAM_SPLINE_CIRCULAR_EASE_OUT        = 24, 
    CAM_SPLINE_CIRCULAR_EASE_IN_OUT     = 25 
};
```

```
NativeDB Added Parameter 4: int renderingOptions : An integer bitmask of eRenderingOptionFlags to apply specific rendering behaviors during the transition. RO_NO_OPTIONS signifies no special options are applied.
```

```
NativeDB Introduced: v323
```

## Parameters
* **bShouldApplyAcrossAllThreads**: If `true`, ensures that the rendering stop request is enforced regardless of other script threads that might still expect rendering to be active. Use with caution to avoid conflicts.
* **distanceToBlend**: Specifies the distance over which the camera should blend from the scripted camera back to the gameplay camera. A value of `0.0` uses the game's default blending distance.
* **blendType**: An integer representing `eCamSplineSmoothingFlags` to determine the smoothness of the camera transition. Common values include `CAM_SPLINE_SLOW_IN_OUT_SMOOTH` among others, defining the easing of the blend.
