## TASK_GO_TO_COORD_ANY_MEANS

```c
// 0x5BC448CB78FA3E88 0xF91DF93B
void TASK_GO_TO_COORD_ANY_MEANS(Ped ped, float x, float y, float z, float fMoveBlendRatio, cs_type(Any) Vehicle vehicle, BOOL bUseLongRangeVehiclePathing, int drivingFlags, float fMaxRangeToShootTargets);
```

Tells a ped to go to a coord by any means.

## Parameters
* **ped**: The `Ped` Handle.
* **x**: The goto target coordinate.
* **y**: The goto target coordinate.
* **z**: The goto target coordinate.
* **fMoveBlendRatio**: 0.0 = still, 1.0 = walk, 2.0 = run, 3.0 = sprint.
* **vehicle**: If defined, the pedestrian will only move if said vehicle exists. If you don't want any sort of association, just set it to `0`.
* **bUseLongRangeVehiclePathing**: Setting to `true` tells the vehicle to use longrange vehicle pathing.
* **drivingFlags**: See `eDrivingMode` enum.
* **fMaxRangeToShootTargets**: Determines the maximum distance at which the `Ped` will engage in combat with threatening targets.
