## _SET_AI_GLOBAL_PATH_NODES_TYPE

// 0xF74B1FFA4A15FBEA
void _SET_AI_GLOBAL_PATH_NODES_TYPE(int type);
```

Activates Cayo Perico path nodes if passed `1`. GPS navigation will start working, maybe more stuff will change, not sure. It seems if you try to unload (pass `0`) when close to the island, your game might crash.
