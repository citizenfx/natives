## _0x6AFD2CD753FEEF83

```c
// 0x6AFD2CD753FEEF83 0x628F489B
BOOL _0x6AFD2CD753FEEF83(char* playerName);
```

```
I put the argument as 'playerName' as when it's called in freemode.c TU27 X360 scripts. It's given a var that has GET_PLAYER_NAME stored in it via StringCopy.  
```

## Parameters
* **playerName**: 

## Return value
