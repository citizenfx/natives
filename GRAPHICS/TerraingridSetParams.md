## TERRAINGRID_SET_PARAMS

```c
// 0x1C4FC5752BCD8E48 0x3B637AA7
void TERRAINGRID_SET_PARAMS(float x, float y, float z, float p3, float rotation, float p5, float width, float height, float p8, float scale, float glowIntensity, float normalHeight, float heightDiff);
```

This native is used along with these two natives: [`0xa356990e161c9e65`](https://runtime.fivem.net/doc/reference.html#_0xA356990E161C9E65) and [`0x5ce62918f8d703c7`](https://runtime.fivem.net/doc/reference.html#_0x5CE62918F8D703C7). 

This native configures the location, size, rotation, normal height, and the difference ratio between min, normal and max.

All those natives combined they will output something like this: https://i.imgur.com/TC6cku6.png

## Parameters
* **x**: Grid center x coord.
* **y**: Grid center y coord.
* **z**: Grid center z coord.
* **p3**: Not sure, but seems to be the amount of lines top/bottom there are in the grid. -1.0 works best.
* **rotation**: Grid rotation (keep between 0.0 and 1.0).
* **p5**: Offset top/bottom (? not sure about this one, seems weird).
* **width**: Grid width (usually 15.0).
* **height**: Grid height (usually 15.0).
* **p8**: Not sure, but seems to be the amount of lines left/right there are in the grid. -1.0 works best.
* **scale**: Zoom / scale (higher values = smaller (more) squares) (lower values = bigger (less) squares).
* **glowIntensity**: glow intensity / opacity (40.0 is fine for daylight, 15.0 is fine for night time).
* **normalHeight**: The z coord for 'normal' height (white grid lines level).
* **heightDiff**: This is the height difference/margin used for line color changes. 0.2 works fine (normalHeight + 0.2 = yellow, normalHeight - 0.2 = red).

## Examples
```cs
N_0xa356990e161c9e65(true); // toggle on/off

// this native configures the location, size, rotation, normal height, and the difference ratio between min, normal and max.
N_0x1c4fc5752bcd8e48(-1114.121f, 220.789f, 63.78f, -1f, 0.85f, 0f, 15f, 15f, -1f, 20f, 40f, 63.78f, 0.2f);

// This native defines the colors (and alpha/opacity levels) for min, normal and max heights.
// (in this case: red for lower, white for normal, yellow for higher)
N_0x5ce62918f8d703c7(255, 0, 0, 64, 255, 255, 255, 5, 255, 255, 0, 64);
```
