## SET_DISABLE_EXPLODE_FROM_BODY_DAMAGE_ON_COLLISION

```c
// 0x26E13D440E7F6064
void SET_DISABLE_EXPLODE_FROM_BODY_DAMAGE_ON_COLLISION(Vehicle vehicle, cs_type(float) BOOL disableExplode);
```

Prevents a vehicle from exploding upon sustaining body damage from physical collisions. This can be used to increase the durability of vehicles in high-impact scenarios, such as races or combat situations, by preventing them from being destroyed due to collision-induced body damage.

For helicopters, you might want to check [`SET_DISABLE_HELI_EXPLODE_FROM_BODY_DAMAGE`](#_0xEDBC8405B3895CC9) instead.

## Parameters
* **vehicle**: The vehicle to apply this setting to.

```

```javascript
// Retrieve the player ped
