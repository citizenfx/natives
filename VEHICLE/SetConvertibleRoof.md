## SET_CONVERTIBLE_ROOF

```c
// 0xF39C4F538B5124C2 0xC87B6A51
void SET_CONVERTIBLE_ROOF(Vehicle vehicle, BOOL toggle);
```
This allows for the vehicle's roof to be put on when set to true, and removed when set to false, provided that the vehicle has a version with a roof and a version without a roof.

#### Vehicles with both roofed and roofless versions (others may exist; this list is compiled from decompiled scripts).

* chino
* voltic
* buccaneer
* buccaneer2
* chino2
* faction
* faction2
* mamba


## Parameters
* **vehicle**: The vehicle to which the roof state will be applied.
* **toggle**: Boolean value where `true` adds the roof and `false` removes it, applicable only if the vehicle has a version with and without a roof.

## Examples

-- In this case we are removing the roof from the vehicle.
local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false)
SetConvertibleRoof(vehicle, false)
```
