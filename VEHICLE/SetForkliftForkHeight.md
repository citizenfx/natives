## SET_FORKLIFT_FORK_HEIGHT

```c
// 0x37EBBF3117BD6A25 0x943A6CFC
void SET_FORKLIFT_FORK_HEIGHT(Vehicle vehicle, float height);
```

```
0.0 = Lowest 1.0 = Highest. This is best to be used if you wanna pick-up a car since un-realistically on GTA V forklifts can't pick up much of anything due to vehicle mass. If you put this under a car then set it above 0.0 to a 'lifted-value' it will raise the car with no issue lol
```

## Parameters
* **vehicle**: 
* **height**:
