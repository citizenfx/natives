## RESTART_GAME

```c
// 0xE574A662ACAEFBB1
void RESTART_GAME();
```

In singleplayer it does exactly what the name implies. In FiveM / GTA:Online it shows the `Disconnecting from GTA Online` warning screen message and quits the game.
After quitting, the game process is started again (as the name implies).
