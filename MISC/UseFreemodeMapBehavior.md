## _USE_FREEMODE_MAP_BEHAVIOR

```c
// 0x9BAE5AD2508DF078 0x721B2492
void _USE_FREEMODE_MAP_BEHAVIOR(BOOL toggle);
```

```
Formerly known as _LOWER_MAP_PROP_DENSITY and wrongly due to idiots as _ENABLE_MP_DLC_MAPS.  
Sets the maximum prop density and changes a loading screen flag from 'loading story mode' to 'loading GTA Online'. Does not touch DLC map data at all.  
In fact, I doubt this changes the flag whatsoever, that's the OTHER native idiots use together with this that does so, this one only causes a loading screen to show as it reloads map data.  
------------------------  
While you're going on your rant about other "idiots" can you please supply the name of the "other native" for us "idiots" who'd like to actually learn about loading IPL's? Thank, you.
