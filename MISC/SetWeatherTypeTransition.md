## _SET_WEATHER_TYPE_TRANSITION

```c
// 0x578C752848ECFA0C 0x5CA74040
void _SET_WEATHER_TYPE_TRANSITION(Hash weatherType1, Hash weatherType2, float percentWeather2);
```

```
Mixes two weather types. If percentWeather2 is set to 0.0f, then the weather will be entirely of weatherType1, if it is set to 1.0f it will be entirely of weatherType2. If it's set somewhere in between, there will be a mixture of weather behaviors.  
Note that unlike most of the other weather natives, this native takes the hash of the weather name, not the plain string. These are the weather names and their hashes:  
CLEAR	0x36A83D84
EXTRASUNNY 0x97AA0A79
CLOUDS 0x30FDAF5C
OVERCAST 0xBB898D2D

SMOG 0x10DCF4B5
FOGGY 0xAE737644
XMAS 0xAAC9C895
SNOWLIGHT 0x23FB812B
BLIZZARD 0x27EA2814
```

## Parameters
* **weatherType1**: The first weather type hash
* **weatherType2**: The second weather type hash
* **percentWeather2**: The value between 0 and 1 to mix weatherType1 and weatherType2
