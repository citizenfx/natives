## STOP_FIRE_IN_RANGE

```c
// 0x056A8A219B8E829F 0x725C7205
void STOP_FIRE_IN_RANGE(float x, float y, float z, float radius);
```

```
This doesn't stop fire nor the fire propagation in a loop... for some reasons.  

Edit: Tested in a for loop it does in fact stop fires within range and does work as a Native. 

Ex: StopFireInRange(x,y,z,60.00) - tested example works. 
```

## Parameters
* **x**: 
* **y**: 
* **z**: 
* **radius**:
