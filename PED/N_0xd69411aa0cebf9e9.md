## _0xD69411AA0CEBF9E9

```c
// 0xD69411AA0CEBF9E9 0x87A0C174
void _0xD69411AA0CEBF9E9(Ped ped, int p1, int p2, int p3);
```

```
Something related to the environmental effects natives.  
In the "agency_heist3b" script, p1 - p3 are always under 100 - usually they are {87, 81, 68}. If SET_PED_ENVEFF_SCALE is set to 0.65 (instead of the usual 1.0), they use {74, 69, 60}  
```

## Parameters
* **ped**: 
* **p1**: 
* **p2**: 
* **p3**:
