(*) When flagId is set to 33 and the bool value to true, peds will die by starting ragdoll, so you should set this flag to false when you resurrect a ped.
When flagId is set to 62 and the boolvalue to false this happens: Ped is taken out of vehicle and can't get back in when jacking their empty vehicle. If in a plane it falls from the sky and crashes. Sometimes peds vehicle continue to drive the route without its driver who's running after.
(*)
JUMPING CHANGES  60,61,104 TO FALSE
BEING ON WATER CHANGES 60,61 TO FALSE AND 65,66,168 TO TRUE
FALLING CHANGES 60,61,104,276 TO FALSE AND TO 76 TRUE
DYING CHANGES 60,61,104,276* TO FALSE AND (NONE) TO TRUE
DYING MAKES 60,61,104 TO FALSE
BEING IN A CAR CHANGES 60,79,104 TO FALSE AND 62 TO TRUE
(*)Maximum value for flagId is 0x1AA (426) in b944.
ID 0xF0 (240) appears to be a special flag which is handled different compared to the others IDs.
