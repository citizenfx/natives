## REMOVE_MODEL_HIDE

```c
// 0xD9E3006FB3CBD765 0x993DBC10
void REMOVE_MODEL_HIDE(float x, float y, float z, float radius, Hash model, BOOL p5);
```

```
p5 = usually false in scripts,  
Same as the comment for CREATE_MODEL_SWAP unless for some reason p5 affects it this only works with objects as well.  
Network players do not see changes done with this.  
```

## Parameters
* **x**: 
* **y**: 
* **z**: 
* **radius**: 
* **model**: 
* **p5**:
